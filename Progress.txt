// Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Assessment
Non-Functional Requirements Assessment
Performance

NFR1. 90% of requests <2s:
⚠️ Partially Met — Flask is fast for most operations; actual performance depends on deployment and data size.
NFR2. Bookings/payments <5s:
⚠️ Partially Met — Booking logic is efficient; payment speed depends on integration and network.
Security

NFR3. Secure password hashing:
✅ Complete — Uses Werkzeug’s password hashing.
NFR4. Enforce HTTPS:
⚠️ Partially Met — Not enforced in code; should be set up in production server config.
NFR5. Input validation (SQLi/XSS):
✅ Complete — WTForms and Flask-WTF used for validation and CSRF protection.
NFR6. Role-based access:
✅ Complete — Admin/user roles and decorators implemented.
Usability

NFR7. Responsive, intuitive UI:
✅ Complete — Bootstrap and custom CSS used; UI is responsive.
NFR8. Error messages and validation:
✅ Complete — WTForms and Flask flash messages provide feedback.
Availability

NFR9. 99% uptime:
⚠️ Partially Met — Depends on production hosting; not enforced in code.
NFR10. Error logging:
✅ Complete — Uses Flask’s logger for error/exception logging.
Maintainability

NFR11. Flask/PEP8 conventions:
✅ Complete — Code structure follows Flask best practices and is modular.
NFR12. Modular/reusable code:
✅ Complete — Uses Blueprints and utility modules.
Scalability

NFR13. 500 concurrent users:
⚠️ Partially Met — Flask can scale with proper deployment (e.g., Gunicorn, WSGI); not load-tested.
NFR14. Scalable DB/server:
⚠️ Partially Met — SQLite for dev, can switch to PostgreSQL; scaling depends on deployment.
Interoperability

NFR15. REST APIs for integration:
⛔ Not Implemented — No REST API endpoints found; can be added in future upgrades.
Summary Table
NFR	Status	Notes
NFR1–NFR2	⚠️ Partial	Fast for most use, but not load-tested
NFR3	✅ Complete	Secure password hashing in place
NFR4	⚠️ Partial	HTTPS must be enforced in deployment
NFR5–NFR6	✅ Complete	Input validation and role-based access
NFR7–NFR8	✅ Complete	Responsive UI and good error feedback
NFR9	⚠️ Partial	Uptime depends on hosting
NFR10	✅ Complete	Error logging via Flask logger
NFR11–NFR12	✅ Complete	Modular, PEP8-compliant code
NFR13–NFR14	⚠️ Partial	Scalable with proper deployment
NFR15	⛔ Not Done	No REST API endpoints yet
Summary:

Most security, usability, and maintainability requirements are fully met.
Performance, availability, and scalability are partially met (depend on deployment and load testing).
REST API interoperability is not yet implemented.
