  routes/: Blueprint modules for different app sections:
    auth.py: Authentication (login, register, password reset).
    bookings.py: Booking logic, booking management.
    main.py: Main pages, admin/user dashboards, manage users.
    tours.py: Tour browsing, CRUD, admin management.
  static/
    css/: Custom stylesheets.
    images/: Tour and upload images.
    js/: JavaScript for UI enhancements (e.g., image preview).
  templates/
    base.html: Main layout, navbar, and footer.
    index.html: Homepage, includes "Get In Touch" section.
    dashboard.html: User/admin dashboard.
    about.html: About Us page.
    admin/: Admin-specific templates (e.g., manage users).
    auth/: Auth-related templates.
    bookings/: Booking-related templates.
    tours/: Tour browsing, detail, create/edit, manage.

Root Files
  config.py: App configuration (secret key, DB URI, upload settings).
  requirements.txt: Python dependencies.
  run.py: App entry point.
  create_sample_tours.py: Script to populate sample tour data.
  create_admin.py, make_admin.py: Scripts for admin user creation.

instance/
  travel_app.db: SQLite database (default).

migrations/
  Alembic migration scripts for database schema changes.


Core Libraries and Extensions
- Flask: Web framework.
- Flask-Login: User session management.
- Flask-WTF: Form handling and CSRF protection.
- Flask-SQLAlchemy: ORM for database models.
- Flask-Migrate: Database migrations.
- Flask-Admin: Admin interface for DB management.
- WTForms: Form validation.
- Werkzeug: Security utilities (e.g., password hashing).
- Jinja2: Templating engine.


Main Features
- User Authentication: Register, login, password reset, profile management.
- Tour Browsing: Search, filter, and view tour details.
- Booking System: Book tours, manage bookings, update/cancel, view history.
- Admin Dashboard: Manage tours, users, categories, and view database schema.
- File Uploads: Upload and manage tour images.
- Responsive UI: Modern, mobile-friendly design.
- Security: CSRF protection, access control, input validation.


Important Syntax and Patterns
- Blueprints: Modularizes routes (e.g., bookings_bp = Blueprint("bookings", ...)).
- Decorators: Used for access control (@login_required, @active_user_required).
- Flask Forms: WTForms for validation (form = BookingForm()).
- Flask-Admin: Registered in __init__.py for /admin interface.
- Jinja2 Templates: Use url_for('static', filename='...') for static files and url_for('route_name') for links.
- Database Models: SQLAlchemy models with relationships and custom fields.
- File Uploads: Handled via Flask config and utility functions, with validation and preview in forms.
- CSRF Protection: Enabled in all forms via Flask-WTF.


Admin Features
- Manage Tours: Create, edit, delete, activate/deactivate, manage images.
- Manage Users: Search, filter, toggle admin status, delete users (with safety checks).
- Flask-Admin: Full DB management and schema visualization.
- Quick Actions: Dashboard links for common admin tasks.


User Features
- Browse Tours: Search/filter, view details, see availability.
- Book Tours: Only if logged in and tour is available.
- Manage Bookings: View, update, or cancel bookings.
- Profile Management: Edit profile, change password, view booking history.


Booking Logic
- Availability Check: Prevents overbooking and booking unavailable tours.
- Booking Reference: Unique code generated for each booking.
- Status Handling: Bookings can be pending, confirmed, cancelled, or completed.
- Update/Cancel Restrictions: Cannot update/cancel within 48 hours of tour date or after completion.
- Server-Side Validation: All booking actions are validated on the backend.


File Uploads
- Tour Images: Uploaded via admin forms, validated for type/size, previewed before upload.
- Storage: Images stored in static/images/tours/ or uploads/.
- Cleanup: Old images deleted on update/delete to save space.


Security
- CSRF Protection: All forms protected via Flask-WTF.
- Access Control: Decorators restrict access to authenticated users/admins.
- Input Validation: WTForms and server-side checks prevent invalid data.
- File Validation: Only allowed file types and sizes are accepted for uploads.


How to Run
1. Install dependencies.
2. Set up the database.
3. Run the app.
4. Access the app:
   - Main site: http://localhost:5000/
   - Admin: http://localhost:5000/admin


Extending the App
- Payment Integration: Add payment gateway logic in booking flow.
- REST API: Expose endpoints for mobile or third-party integration.
- Reporting: Add analytics and reporting for admins.
- Deployment: Configure for production (e.g., Gunicorn, Docker, cloud hosting).


Example: Booking Route Logic

Errors encountered

Travel App – Errors Encountered and Fixes Applied

Overview
This section summarizes the major errors, issues, and bugs encountered during the development of the Flask-based travel app, along with representative solutions.

1. Static File Path Issues
Problem: Templates used hardcoded static paths (e.g., ../static/images/...), causing images and CSS to not load.
Fix: Replaced all static file references with url_for('static', filename='...') in templates like base.html and index.html.

2. Route Name Mismatches
Problem: Template links pointed to non-existent or outdated routes, resulting in 404 errors.
Fix: Audited and updated all url_for() calls to match blueprint route names (e.g., tours.detail).

3. Database Model Field Name Inconsistencies
Problem: Code and templates referenced old model field names (e.g., name instead of title), causing AttributeError and broken search/filter features.
Fix: Updated all references to new field names and fixed sample data scripts.

4. File Upload Implementation Issues
Problem: No file upload support for tour images; forms lacked proper encoding and validation.
Fix: Added file upload forms, backend logic, and validation in utils.py and related templates.

5. CSRF Protection Gaps
Problem: Some forms lacked CSRF tokens, leading to security vulnerabilities and submission errors.
Fix: Ensured all forms include CSRF tokens and updated backend validation.

6. Booking Logic and Validation Errors
Problem: Users could book unavailable tours or overbook; no server-side validation.
Fix: Added backend checks for tour availability and participant limits in booking routes.

7. Admin/User Management Issues
Problem: No admin interface for user management; missing safety checks for user deletion.
Fix: Integrated Flask-Admin, created a custom Manage Users page, and added admin safety checks.

8. Navigation and Link Consistency
Problem: Broken dashboard links and inconsistent Contact links.
Fix: Standardized all navigation using url_for() and ensured all links point to valid routes or homepage sections.

9. Template Inheritance and Block Issues
Problem: Child templates failed to display content or load CSS/JS due to block mismatches.
Fix: Standardized template inheritance and block naming across all templates.

10. Form Validation and Error Handling
Problem: Forms accepted invalid data and provided poor error feedback.
Fix: Enhanced WTForms validation and improved error message display in templates.

This summary covers the most common and impactful errors. For a full list and detailed fixes, see the dedicated error documentation file.
